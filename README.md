PRISM-Scripts
===================
These PRISM scripts are designed with the goal of saving hundreds of hours of processing time for Child Support officers and staff, by automating simple tasks in the state's Child Support mainframe system. 

At this time, supported use of these scripts is restricted to agencies who are contributing their own script code to the project. As has been stipulated by the multiple MN counties working on this project. If you are interested in contributing code to the project, please contact Robert Fewins-Kalb (Anoka's Technical Analyst/Operations Coordinator) at robert.kalb@co.anoka.mn.us.
